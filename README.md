This is chating web app base on react js and socket.io 

there are two repo "server01" and client01

.................server01................

got to terminal and run command cd server01 for enter server01 repo 
now you have server01 
then "npm run dev" command to start server

now you can see in terminal server in listening in "3001" port 
your server is ready 

next...

................ client01................. 


In client01 have two rep "client02" and client03 

both are client but you must use client03 becouse it complites with ui inter face 

now go to terminal and run command in client03 
command "npm run dev" 

now client03 start and you have a link in terminal witho port number
